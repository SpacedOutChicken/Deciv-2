# DeCiv 2
Rebuild civilization after the end of the world. A fork of DeCiv Redux.

Differences from DeCiv Redux:
- Two additional factions, The Hunnu (Mongolian themed tribals/raiders) and Prasiddh Shahar (Indian vyomanauts who rode out the Cataclysm on their space station)
- One additional City-State
- Ten new technologies (and one old technology removed)
- Several new buildings, wonders, improvements, resources, etc.
- No gold-to-science slider (but there is a separate add-on mod to re-enable it [here](https://github.com/the-s-is-silent/Restore-the-Gold-Slider-in-Deciv-2))
- And many other balance edits as detailed in the Changelog file
