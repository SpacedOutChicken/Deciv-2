# DeCiv 2
Rebuild civilization after the end of the world. A fork of DeCiv Redux.

Differences from DeCiv Redux:
- Two additional factions, The Hunnu (Mongolian themed tribals/raiders) and Prasiddh Shahar (Indian vyomanauts who rode out the Cataclysm on their space station)
- Ten new technologies (and one old technology removed)
- Several new buildings, wonders, improvements, resources, etc.
- No gold-to-science slider
- And many other balance edits as detailed in the Changelog file
