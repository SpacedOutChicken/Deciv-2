## A comprehensive list of known mods for the DeCiv ruleset

#### Versions of DeCiv
- [DeCiv](https://github.com/GeneralWadaling/DeCiv) (The original mod from 9kgsofrice and currently owned by The Bucketeer, long abandoned)
- [DeCiv Redux](https://github.com/SpacedOutChicken/DeCiv-Redux) (The main branch of the resurrected mod. Was supposed to have a major overhaul Spring 2024, but is currently only updated as needed to fix bugs and deprecated uniques)
- [DeCiv 1](https://github.com/SpacedOutChicken/DeCiv-1) (Side branch that preserves the state of DeCiv as it was in before Lodo and Sullien revived it, only updated as needed to fix bugs and deprecated uniques)
- [DeCiv 2](https://github.com/SpacedOutChicken/Deciv-2) (Side branch that continues the "pre-Rebirth" state of DeCiv Redux and is currently the most up-to-date version of DeCiv, has two new factions not present in Redux along with some balance changes)

#### Active Expansion/Rebalance Mods
- [A New Dawn](https://github.com/ReallyBasicName/A-New-Dawn) (WIP, will add several factions once finished)
- [Bamboo DeCiv Expans](https://github.com/RealBamboolord/Bamboo-Deciv-Expans) and its companion [TCC-beta](https://github.com/NotBamboolord/TCC-beta) (A bit of trivia here: Bamboolord's main DeCiv mod is the second oldest known DeCiv expansion mod on Github, with only Elysium having existed for longer)
- [Canal DeCiv v2](https://github.com/fabi0M/CANAL_DECIV_V2) (I see someone was experimenting with terraforming features to make a canal mod)
- [Communism on Wasteland](https://github.com/chenxing61/Communism-on-Wasteland) (Technically hasn't been updated for a while, but the owner is active and likely will update as needed)
- [CS Rework for DeCiv](https://github.com/the-s-is-silent/CS-Rework-for-DeCiv) (If you're among the rare few who wanted Civ 6's Suzerainty bonuses added to DeCiv's City-States, then this is the mod for you. Warning: this mod does not seem to work consistently.)
- [DeCiv Nation](https://github.com/EmperorVboiuerfg/Deciv-Nation)
- [DeCiv Unit Limiting](https://github.com/Calais-Osterrepublic/DeCiv-Unit-Limiting) (A difficulty mod putting stricter caps on how many military units you can have at any given time.)
- [Followers of the Green for DeCiv](https://github.com/carriontrooper/Followers-of-the-Green-for-Deciv) (WIP, faction pack focused on naturalist / solarpunk / biotech themes)
- [Forgotten Factions for DeCiv](https://github.com/carriontrooper/Forgotten-Factions-for-Deciv) (A collection of factions from other users' expansion mods that were ultimately abandoned and revived here, though some had to be built from scratch. Current number of factions resurrected or reimagined: 11.)
- [Free Cities to DeCiv](https://github.com/Inkognito-secret/Free-Cites-to-DeCiv) (WIP, includes one faction: Svobodnie Goroda, the "Free Cities Conference")
- [Kingdom of DeCiv](https://github.com/EPG333/Kingdom-of-Deciv) (Includes one faction, the very appropriately named Forgotten Kingdom. Owner is currently on hiatus)
- [Lights, Camera, Destruction](https://github.com/PAFR2003/LightsCameraDestruction) (Includes two factions, Reactorland and Red Lotus Society)
- [More Wonders for DeCiv](https://github.com/the-s-is-silent/More-Wonders-for-DeCiv) (For those who want to reintroduce a race for wonders which is absent from DeCiv Redux. WIP, community project, also allows players access to the wonders from Deciv 2 and Outlaws without using those mods)
- [Order of Dagon for DeCiv](https://github.com/ReallyBasicName/Order-of-Dagon-for-Deciv) (Self-explanatory, bit of a WIP)
- [Outlaws of the Wastes](https://github.com/the-s-is-silent/Outlaws-of-the-Wastes) (A massive overhaul of Redux/2. While there are some things that can't be changed by an expansion mod, this one rebalances the majority of content in the base scenario, drawing heavily from Rekmod. It also adds more additional content than any other DeCiv expansion mod: ruins bonuses from barbarian camps, nine new factions (one of which was originally a City-State in Redux), eleven new City-States, two new social policy trees, and a lot of new buildings, units, beliefs, etc., while preserving compatibility with other expansion mods.)
- [Slightly Less Unfair AI in DeCiv](https://github.com/the-s-is-silent/Slightly-Less-Unfair-AI-in-DeCiv) (A minor "difficulty" mod that very slightly reduces game difficulty by blocking the AI from building settlers during the first 20 turns of a new game.)
- [Steampunk Nations for DeCiv](https://github.com/carriontrooper/Steampunk-Nations-for-Deciv) (Can be best described as "Empires of the Smoky Skies" revisited for the post-apocalypse, but has recently been expanded to cover other types of Punk. Currently includes seven factions along with a new strategic resource and a few standalone buildings which provide that resource. The average power level of these factions is significantly higher than both the base scenario and most other mods.)
- The Mechanized Rebalance Mods (Because Bamboolord's signature faction, which he has abandoned due to a complete loss of motivation, has proven to be the most notoriously difficult faction in DeCiv to balance correctly)
    - Attempt #1: [The Mechanized, Refurbished](https://github.com/the-s-is-silent/The-Mechanized-Refurbished)
    - Attempt #2: [The Mechanized, Derusted](https://github.com/EPG333/The-Mechanized-Derusted)
- [VividVale Decivilised](https://github.com/BennieCUBED/VividVale-Decivilised) (Umm...okay. This is a thing.)
- [Wasteland Happenings](https://github.com/the-s-is-silent/Wasteland-Happenings) (Adds random events, some of which significantly increase game difficulty. Also includes all of the Barbarian units added to Outlaws of the Wastes along with a few other units.)

#### Inactive (or Abandoned) Expansion/Rebalance Mods
- [Dandelion](https://github.com/PAFR2003/Dandelion) (Revived by Indonesian Gentleman in "Forgotten Factions for DeCiv")
- [DeCiv: Return of the Middle Kingdom](https://github.com/Jinmjjjhrf/Deciv-Return-of-the-Middle-Kingdom) (An unfortunately abandoned expansion mod that would have focused on post-Cataclysm faction warfare in China. The two factions present at the time of abandonment were revived by Indonesian Gentleman in "Forgotten Factions for DeCiv")
- [DeCiv Redux addOn](https://github.com/TheresNoLama/DeCiv-Redux-addOn) (Yes, this is the same person who forked the "Communism on Wasteland" mod and made it more OP. Who was attempting to make their own more proper expansion mod now, though they're certainly likely to end up violating a lot of lore in the process should they come back and flesh this out more.)
- [DeCiv Redux Fairplay Mod](https://github.com/Monokiro/Deciv-Redux-Fairplay-Mod)
- [DeCiv Redux Plus](https://github.com/kudcrafts/DeCiv-Redux-Plus) (This fork was attempting to revert terrain/resources and other stuff back to the Unciv Gods & Kings ruleset and has not been updated in over two years)
- [Elysium for DeCiv Redux](https://github.com/HaneulCheong/Elysium-for-DeCiv-Redux) (Revived by Indonesian Gentleman in "Forgotten Factions for DeCiv")
- [Fallout Factions for DeCiv](https://github.com/ReallyBasicName/Fallout-Factions-for-Deciv) (WIP, means to import many of the major factions and some of the minor factions from the Fallout series into DeCiv. Currently on hiatus)
- ["Fixed" Outlaws](https://github.com/TomXPL/Fixed-Outlaws) (A fork of Outlaws of the Wastes that reduces the minimum distance between cities instead of increasing it. This version was made for personal use solely because Outlaws interferes with "Closer City Distance" mods, and has not been updated since the Aztl√°n update to the main mod.)
- [Giulian7's DeCiv Reworked](https://github.com/Giulian7/DeCiv-Reworked) (While it actually did update recently, it's still essentially abandoned and its one original faction is being revived by Indonesian Gentleman in "Forgotten Factions for DeCiv")
    - Its continuation: [DeCiv Reworked - Metro](https://github.com/Giulian7/DeCiv-Reworked---Metro)
- [Hex DeCiv Redux](https://github.com/Hexelix/Hex-DeCiv-Redux) (No new content, just personal tweaks to existing content. Also no updates since late July 2023.)
- [Metro 2033 Factions for DeCiv](https://github.com/ReallyBasicName/Metro-2033-factions-for-Deciv) (Currently a WIP and one that won't see active development until its owner finishes the Fallout Factions mod)
- [Naciones pa Deciv ES](https://github.com/Belias02/Naciones-pa-deciv-ES) (Includes four factions, abandoned by owner due to stress from university, revived by Indonesian Gentleman in "Forgotten Factions for DeCiv")
- [Policies for DeCiv](https://github.com/Belias02/PoliciesforDeciv) (see above)
- [The Raiders](https://github.com/Belias02/The-raiders) (see above. Basically "The Barbarians" mod for DeCiv minus the additional ruins bonuses and units)
- [SeventhM's DeCiv Redux Reworked](https://github.com/SeventhM/Deciv-Redux-Reworked) (A full Rekmod-style overhaul of DeCiv Redux, however this mod removes more content than it adds)

#### Blatantly Overpowered Cheat Mods
- [DeCiv Unbalanced](https://github.com/the-s-is-silent/DeCiv-Unbalanced)
- [DeCiv USSR](https://github.com/Doomstar00/DeCiv-USSR)
